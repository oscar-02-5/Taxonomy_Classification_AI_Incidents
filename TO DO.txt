-Update labels
-Check the number of incidents and reports
-Approaches to labeling
-
-Project timeline and next steps:
	- Fine tuning on zero-shot.
	-Dashboard to show information (gradio from hugging face)
	- Prompt engineering? to compare accuracies




Finish labeling the dataset. Make sure it is properly labeled.
Calculate the accuracy of the zero-shot model
Do fine tuning to the zero-shot model
Calculate the accuracy of the finetune model and see that it is > 90. If not, go to step 3.
Make Gradio Interface (two tabs). One to write the incident and classify it and another to see all the incidents classified by taxonomies.
Extra: Test the prompt engineering (with hugging face models) and see if it improves the accuracy of the model you have fine-tuned.
